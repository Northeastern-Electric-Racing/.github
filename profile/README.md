We are a student-run organization at Northeastern University building all-electric formula-style race cars from scratch to compete in Formula Hybrid + Electric and Formula SAE.

Our software team is a diverse group of software, computer, and electrical engineers committed to developing quality products and applications. The scope of the software team ranges from writing the code for real-time firmware control of critical automotive systems to developing a fully featured project management dashboard to maintain the timeline and organization required for building a racecar annually.
